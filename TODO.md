 - ### seperate game and engine
 - seperating the rendering from the other stuff so 3D support can be added easier
 - gui via imgui
 - make the engine a standalone app
 - lua scripting as main scripting/serialisation language
 - projekt template that gets placed as new projekt that can be edited
 - easy for the user (game dev) multiplayer support
 - build support for mac, linux and windows
 - ### 3D support
   - rendering
   - collision
   - physiks
   - scripting API

# maybe
 - Python as additional scripting language
 - C# as additional scripting language
 - hot swap for c++ via dll loading
